# MazeGame
First Part of the 2e10 Group Z8 Gold Demo. It uses the arduino buggy as a game controller for a maze game in unity. All of demos for gold do not require any change in wiring from our silver challenge demo. For this one in perticular all you need is two IR sensors on pins 2 and 3 to reset the orientation. The repo contains an arduino .ino file, unity project, and a compiled version of the program used in the demo.
